    Hello everyone! Welcome to the MSDT Games website! My business partner and I make
video games because ever since I was a little kid, I've wanted to create video games,
and I learned to code 2 years ago. Now I am medium-experienced, and my business
partner helps me a lot. I also have an advantage because I draw too, so it's easier
to make background art, for example. Now (because of my impulsive decision making),
I'm stuck in the middle of about 3 different projects (including this website), so
this website might be underdeveloped for a while. It'll also take me a few months to
finish the games I'm working on with my business partner, so sorry about that. :(

    Until then, you can check out some of our online HTML5 games (and you don't have
to worry about losing them just because of the horrible decision by all web browser
developers to completely get rid of Adobe Flash Player), write reviews of them, and
chat with your friends. Have a wonderful time doing...whatever! That's it from me.
